## Recommended Migration to QuickShop-Hikari

QuickShop-Reremake (v5.1.2.5) is broken in Paper 1.20.5+ Server  
You can download the support version from Github releases and then [migrate to QuickShop-Hikari(CLICK ME)](https://ghost-chu.github.io/QuickShop-Hikari-Documents/docs/addon/reremake-migrator)  
I strongly do not recommend this version of QuickShop-Reremake for use on the server  
Because there are many bugs and broken features in Paper 1.20.5+ Server.  
I **only recommend you use this version to migrate to QuickShop-Hikari**  

**This is a 3rd-party build**
